Activerecord for Processing
---------------------------

I hacked this together as I got peed off with using java
to handle accessing my mySQL databases from inside processing
and sorely missed the wonderful powers of ActiveRecord.

The library includes a copy of ActiveRecord and ActiveSupport 
taken from rails (version 2.1.0).

http://github.com/rails/rails

I've only tested this using mysql - but it should work for 
other database types supported by ActiveRecord.  Just set 
up the config/database.yml file accordingly (see the rails 
documentation if you don't know how to do this)

http://api.rubyonrails.org/

To use:

  (there's an example 'active_record_test.rb' in the samples folder)

  * place the active_record_for_processing directory 
    in the ruby-processing/library folder.
    
  * set up your database configuration in config/database.yml.

  * load the library in your processing app:

    class MyProcessingApp < Processing::App

      load_ruby_library "active_record_for_processing"

      # do interesting stuff.....
    end

And you should be able to declare an ActiveRecord 
class in the normal way and use it:

class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
end

see the rails api documentation for info on how to 
use ActiveRecord (http://api.rubyonrails.org/).
